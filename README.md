BierenDB is a database (currently MySQL 8) to practice SQL on. I'm in the process of adding a SQLITE database have even more fun.

This project was born to have a form of database to practice SQL on. I'm pretty sure it started at the [Open Beer Database](https://openbeerdb.com). For convenience I've added the original dump from there.

(C) The beer database is licensed under the Database Contents License (DbCL). As far as I know this is compatible with the BSD-2 Clause I normally use.
